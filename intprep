In DevOps, security is integrated throughout the software delivery lifecycle — this is known as DevSecOps. The goal is to build security into every stage of the CI/CD pipeline rather than applying it as a final step.
🔐 Security Tools & Methods in DevOps (DevSecOps)
🔹 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

What it does:
Scans source code or binaries before execution to find vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow).

Tools:

    ✅ SonarQube

    ✅ Checkmarx

    ✅ Fortify

    ✅ CodeQL (GitHub)

Use in pipeline: Run in the build phase of CI/CD.
🔹 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

What it does:
Scans running applications to identify security flaws by simulating attacks.

Tools:

    ✅ OWASP ZAP

    ✅ Burp Suite

    ✅ Arachni

Use in pipeline: Run in staging or test environments.
🔹 3. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

What it does:
Detects vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and open-source dependencies.

Tools:

    ✅ Snyk

    ✅ WhiteSource

    ✅ Black Duck

    ✅ Dependabot

Use in pipeline: During code build or PR phase.
🔹 4. Container Security

What it does:
Scans Docker images for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and secrets.

Tools:

    ✅ Trivy (by Aqua)

    ✅ Clair

    ✅ Anchore

    ✅ Docker Scout

    ✅ Sysdig Secure

Use in pipeline: Before pushing images to registry (e.g., JFrog, ECR).
🔹 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

What it does:
Analyzes Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible code for misconfigurations and compliance issues.

Tools:

    ✅ Checkov

    ✅ TFSec

    ✅ Kics (by Checkmarx)

    ✅ Open Policy Agent (OPA)

    ✅ Terrascan

Use in pipeline: Pre-deployment or during PR review.
🔹 6. Secret Detection

What it does:
Finds hardcoded passwords, API keys, or credentials in source code.

Tools:

    ✅ GitLeaks

    ✅ TruffleHog

    ✅ Detect Secrets (Yelp)

Use in pipeline: During code commit or PR validation.
🔹 7. Runtime Security & Monitoring

What it does:
Detects anomalies, threats, and breaches during application runtime.

Tools:

    ✅ Falco (runtime threat detection for containers)

    ✅ AppArmor / SELinux (Linux hardening)

    ✅ Sysdig Secure

    ✅ Datadog Security Monitoring

🔹 8. Security as Code (Policy as Code)

What it does:
Defines and enforces security policies automatically using code.

Tools:

    ✅ OPA (Open Policy Agent)

    ✅ Kyverno (Kubernetes policy engine)

    ✅ Rego (OPA’s language)

🔹 9. Access Control and Secrets Management

What it does:
Manages secrets, tokens, and passwords securely.

Tools:

    ✅ HashiCorp Vault

    ✅ AWS Secrets Manager

    ✅ Kubernetes Secrets (use with caution)

    ✅ Sealed Secrets (Bitnami)

🔹 10. Compliance and Auditing

What it does:
Ensures adherence to security standards like CIS Benchmarks, PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

Tools:

    ✅ Auditd

    ✅ OpenSCAP

    ✅ Chef InSpec

    ✅ Cloud Custodian
